# N-Puzzle

Algorithmic project: solving sliding puzzles
____

The goal of this project is to solve the N-puzzle ("taquin" in French) game using the A* search algorithm or one of its variants.
You start with a square board made up of N*N cells. One of these cells will be empty, the others will contain numbers, starting from 1, that will be unique in this instance of the puzzle.
Your search algorithm will have to find a valid sequence of moves in order to reach the final state, a.k.a the "snail solution", which depends on the size of the puzzle (Example below). While there will be no direct evaluation of its performance in this instance of the project, it has to have at least a vaguely reasonable perfomance : Taking a few second to solve a 3-puzzle is pushing it, ten seconds is unacceptable.
The only move one can do in the N-puzzle is to swap the empty cell with one of its neighbors (No diagonals, of course. Imagine youâ€™re sliding a block with a number on it towards an empty space).

	1 2 3		 1  2  3  4		   1  2  3  4  5
	8   4		12 13 14  5		  16 17 18 19  6
	7 6 5		11    15  6		  15 24    20  7
	     		10  9  8  7		  14 23 22 21  8

## Generate puzzles

	python3 res_npuzzle-gen.py [-h] [-s] [-u] [-i ITERATIONS] size

	positional arguments:
	size                Size of the puzzle's side. Must be >3.

	optional arguments:
	-h, --help          show this help message and exit
	-s, --solvable      Forces generation of a solvable puzzle. Overrides -u.
	-u, --unsolvable    Forces generation of an unsolvable puzzle
	-i ITERATIONS, --iterations ITERATIONS
                        Number of passes
____

## Run

	python3 main.py [-h] [-g] [-u] [-hr HEURISTIC] [-v VARIANT] file

	positional arguments:
	file                puzzle file

	optional arguments:
	-h, --help          show this help message and exit
	-g, --greedy        greedy bonus
	-u, --ucs           uniform-cost bonus
	-hr HEURISTIC, --heuristic HEURISTIC
                        heuristic (md for manhattan_distance, hd for hamming_distance or lc for linear conflict)
	-v VARIANT, --variant VARIANT
                        coefficient for variant algorithm
____

## Return

The program returns:
- the path to the solution
- the number of nodes explored
- the time and size complexities
- the duration
